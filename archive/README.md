#  Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains two comprehensive Jupyter notebooks developed to predict customer churn using various machine learning models and detailed exploratory data analysis. The project is focused on understanding churn patterns and building robust predictive models using both classical and boosting algorithms.

---

##  Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the key challenges faced by telecom companies. Reducing churn rate can lead to significantly higher profitability. This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of churn prediction â€” from data preprocessing to model building and evaluation.

##  Highlights

### 1. `customer_voting_churn` (Modeling-Focused)

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handled incorrect `TotalCharges` data type.
  - Removed missing values.
  - Converted binary columns to 0/1.
  - Cleaned multi-class categorical variables.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created `AvgMonthlySpend` from `TotalCharges / Tenure`.

- **Modeling Pipeline**:
  - Built pipeline with imputation, encoding, and scaling.
  - Applied several models: RandomForest, LogisticRegression, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost.
  - Tuned models using `Optuna`.
  - Final ensemble: **VotingClassifier (soft)** using `LogisticRegression`, `GradientBoosting`, and `AdaBoost`.

- **Threshold Optimization**:
  - Precision-Recall curve plotted to choose best threshold (0.4).
  - Best model performance at threshold = 0.4:

    ```
    precision    recall  f1-score   support

        0       0.88      0.81      0.84      1035
        1       0.57      0.70      0.63       374

    accuracy                           0.78      1409
    macro avg       0.73      0.75      0.74      1409
    ```

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - ROC AUC Score: **1.0**
  - Average Precision Score: **1.0**
  - Confusion Matrix and Classification Report included.

### 2. `Customer Churn Analysis.ipynb` (Exploratory Data Analysis & LightGBM)

- **EDA & Visualizations**:
  - Barplots, countplots, pie charts, boxplots, histograms.
  - Churn analysis by:
    - Contract type
    - Internet service
    - Payment method
    - Tenure group
    - Paperless billing
    - Senior citizen status
  - Feature correlation and churn heatmaps.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - `StreamingBundle`, `HasBoth`, `TenureBins`, `NoSupportInternet`, `TotalBin`
  - Advanced engineered features:
    - `CostTenureRatio`, `ContractTenure`, `EarlyHighCost`
    - `MissingServicesCount`, `MonthlyCostZ_Risk`
    - `ChurnRiskScore`, `ChurnRiskLevel`, `ChurnRiskScoreBin`

- **Modeling**:
  - Used **LightGBM** with SMOTENC (resampled categorical-aware balancing).
  - Applied categorical type conversion for LightGBM optimization.
  - Tuned model and evaluated on original test set.

- **Model Results**:

    ```
    precision    recall  f1-score   support

        0       0.90      0.76      0.82      1035
        1       0.53      0.76      0.62       374

    accuracy                           0.76      1409
    ROC AUC Score: 0.8312
    Average Precision Score: 0.598
    ```
